# TODO

- fix `ffmpeg` packages for Fedora
- Archive an existing host in 1Password if hostname matches
- dconf package variables should be simplified
- Replace `cht.sh` script with `curl` alias
- Docker role should use `dnf5`
- for macOS, is there a `defaults` for removing tiling margin?
- lesshst and viminfo are being recreated even with env var set
