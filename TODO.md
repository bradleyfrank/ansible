# TODO

> [!IMPORTANT]
> I have tried multiple different colorschemes now and I always come back to **Solarized Light**. If I get the itch to try again, I remind myself: do not waste your time! Keep what is working, and fix minor issues with the individual app's theme instead.

> [!NOTE]
> Packages `tmux` and `fzf` where too old in Ubuntu 22.04 repo


- [ ] The command bar at the top of `tmux` is solarized dark instead of light
- [ ] Remove unnecessary items from Neovim status bar
- [ ] Make Neovim default to two spaces per tab
- [ ] Make **atuin** setup dependent on `atuin status`
- [ ] Fix `ffmpeg` packages for Fedora (specify repo)
- [ ] Archive an existing host in 1Password if hostname exists
- [ ] Refactor **dconf** package variables to be simplier
- [ ] The **docker** role should use `dnf5`
- [ ] Why are `lesshst` and `viminfo` being recreated even with env var set?
